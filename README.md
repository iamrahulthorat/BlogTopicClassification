jupy# Natural Language Processing Project : Blog Topic Classification

Here we are going to solve a supervised multi-class text classification problem in NLP.

**Task:**
+ Downloading the dataset from Kaggle and loading the corpus into dataframe.
+ Pre-processing the textual data.
+ Building a model that will predict the topic from blog posts.

_The dataset we are going to work on can be found here:_
